Since its construction, the library building has undergone two major renovations. The first in the early 1980s, the removal of the children’s porch, the relocation of the main entrance and the creation of a new subterranean Science and Technology Reading Room.  This renovation also included extensive refurbishing of the interior and new furnishings.

The second renovation occurred in the 2000s when the air conditioning system was installed and a glass partition was put up between the main space and the stacks. At this time the basement was also reprogrammed from being a Science and Technology Reading Room following the closure of Pratt’s Engineering School in the mid 1990s to a home for the Multimedia Services Department. This department had to be relocated to the library building following the fire at Higgins Hall, where it was originally located.
