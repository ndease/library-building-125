The new library building included a dedicated gallery space located on the third floor. The gallery, which features a skylight, exhibited items ranging from paintings to artifacts to books, all of which served as study subjects for art and science students alike. While the room where the museum was originally located is now the Alumni Reading Room and used as an event space, the Libraries continue the tradition of exhibiting work by developing exhibitions that take place throught the halls of the building. Likewise, courses at Pratt continue to use the libraries' collections, as well as the building itself, as inspiration for lessons and assignments.
