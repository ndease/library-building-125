In the 25 years since the Centennial, the Pratt Institute Libraries has gone through such major infrastructural changes as the installation of air conditioning in 2000 to the migration to the Millennium Integrated Library System (ILS) in 2007 and the installation of new exhibition cases in 2018 and 2019. These physical changes have been accompanied by the addition of new [collections](https//library.pratt.edu/collections) and [services](https://library.pratt.edu/services), including: zine, graphic novel and artists’ book collections; a major enhancement of the Libraries’ [electronic resources](https://libguides.pratt.edu/az.php); new [digital collections](https://www.jstor.org/site/pratt/) featuring publications and documents from the Pratt Institute Archives; the expansion of the mission of the [archives](https://libguides.pratt.edu/archives) with the hiring of the Virginia Thoren and Institute Archivist; participation in [ConnectNY](https://libguides.pratt.edu/interlibraryloan/cny-faq) a consortium of independence academic Institutions in New York State; a robust [instruction program](https://libguides.pratt.edu/faculty/instruction) to support the curriculum of the Institute; the [Iron and Glass Blog](https://libguides.pratt.edu/blog) which highlights the activities of the Libraries; and an extensive [exhibitions program](https://www.jstor.org/site/pratt/libraries-exhibitions/?searchkey=1652893411421), which includes both student-centered exhibits, and work by renowned artists from inside and outside of Pratt.

Throughout its history, the Libraries have evolved from a small reading room to a multi-branch public library to an academic library with cutting edge services and locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan. We are excited to see what the next 25 years will bring, but we also know that the library building, a New York City landmark still boasting its original Renaissance Revival design, original marble and glass interiors, and iron and oak stacks, will continue to be appreciated by all the information seekers who pass through its doors.
