In 1996 the Library building turned 100 years old. Faculty, staff, and students gathered to commemorate the centennial of the Library's historic building. Celebrations on the day of the Centennial included a cake-cutting ceremony and a reception where the Commissioner of New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, Schuyler Chapin, served as the keynote speaker and Howard Golden, then Borough President of Brooklyn, delivered a proclamation. The elaborate cake was created by Colette Peters, a Pratt MFA graduate. A lecture series on the value of libraries in the 21st century as well as an exhibit were organized for the following weeks.

The celebration launched a year-long campaign centered on the upcoming renovation of the Library as well as the development and preservation of its collections.
