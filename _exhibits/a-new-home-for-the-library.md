By 1895, the library's collection had grown to 61,000 volumes and the library services had outgrown their space at the Main building. A new building was commissioned by Pratt Institute to architect William B. Tubby, who had also designed several Pratt Family buildings.

The three-story brick building was designed in a Renaissance Revival style and features marble staircase and pillars. The interior was designed by Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company with bookstacks made of oak shelves and copper-plated iron supports over glass floors. In addition to Pratt Institute's growing books and serials collections, the Library housed a museum and the School of Library Economy, now the School of Information and one of the country's first library schools. The new library building is currently a New York City Landmark. Additional branches were built in Greenpoint and Boerum Hill.
