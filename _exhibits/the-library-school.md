The Pratt Institute School of Information, established in 1890, is the oldest library school in continuous operation in the United States. Developed from the need to train staff at the Pratt Institute Free Library, the school was located in the library until its move to Manhattan in the 1970s.

Mary Wright Plummer, a student of Melville Dewey, was invited to the library to develop training courses for new librarians in 1890. In 1904, she resigned as head of the library to devote her full attention to the school, which then became an entity separate from the library.
