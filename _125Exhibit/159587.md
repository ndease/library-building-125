description: Library Park was the name given to the grounds to the north and south
  of Pratt Institute's Free Library, which opened in 1896. The Library Park took up
  most of the block between Ryerson and Hall Streets, and DeKalb and Willoughby Avenues,
  though row houses and other residences remained at the ends of the block along DeKalb
  and Willoughby Avenues. By 1915, only the rows houses at Willoughby still stood
  and the park was given an iron fence with brick and granite posts along Ryerson
  Street. Early photographs show a low, metal fence along Ryerson and a taller fence
  along Hall. The fencing along Ryerson was upgraded in 1924 and 1925, when ornate
  gates were installed to enter the Library Park. These upgraded gates were eventually
  removed in 1960, signaling the end of the Library Park.
