description: The Pratt Institute Library was built as a public as well as a college
  library. It is a designated New York City Landmark and part of the Pratt Institute
  Historic District. The building opened in 1896, though the library as an institution
  had existed since 1888. Originally located in the Main Building, it was the first
  free library in Brooklyn. The library building was designed by architect William
  Tubby in the Renaissance Revival style, with Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company
  responsible for the interiors. As designed, the entrance was on the north side of
  the building. The building is notable for its early inclusion of a children's room,
  and in 1912, a dedicated children's entrance fashioned after the Norman staircase
  of Canterbury Cathedral was added to the building's south side. The north porch
  by John Mead Howells, now sealed off, was added in 1936. In 1980, the children's
  porch was removed to make way for an expansion of the basement level and the addition
  of the south plaza.
