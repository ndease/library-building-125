description: The Main Building is a designated New York City Landmark and part of
  the Pratt Institute Historic District. It was designed by Lamb and Rich, an architectural
  firm favored by the Pratt family, and was the first structure erected for Pratt
  Institute. It was soon joined by the Trade School Building (Student Union) and the
  Mechanic Arts Building (East Hall), the other two buildings of the original Pratt
  Institute complex. Constructed in red brick in the Romanesque Revival style, the
  building has a large central clock tower and a portico that was added in 1895. The
  building was damaged by fire in 1910 and again in 2013. The Main Building originally
  contained the library, a museum, the Women's Department, Art Department, and Cooking
  Department; today it houses administrative offices, classrooms, and studios.
